minishell> unset hi
[1]    91275 segmentation fault  ./minishell

unset duzgun adi control yapmiyor hii hi 

cd ~ home 

exit 40 ads exit code needs to be 1

fd_in -1 for missing file

cat <missing not properly working when there is fault in input file

test 88: parsing shoudnt stop when invalid permissions or missing file found
instead redirect to last valid maybe?

echo with pipe fails (echo hi >./outfiles/outfile01 | echo bye >./outfiles/outfile02 )

permission denied / missing file error missing

wtf is 116???

not a command vs is a directory / no such file or directory (133, 137, 141, 142)
